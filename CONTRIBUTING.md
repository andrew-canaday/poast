Contributing
============

> :warning: *Windows-specific bugs or features are best handled by forking this
> repo*.

Contributions are always welcome and appreciated!
Code contributions _will be recorded in the [authors file](./AUTHORS.md)_ (maybe,
also, in the git history - if this is important to you: note it).

Some ways you can contribute are outlined below.

Types of Contributions
----------------------

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at [poast issues](https://github.com/andrew-canaday/poast/issues).

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. All issues open for remediation by
_anyone_. Have a go!

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

It'd bring me so much joy if you contributed by adding to or refining the
documentation for `poast`!

### Submit Feedback

If you have a feature request, there are two options:
 - Provide a *compelling, detailed, explanation* and submit it as [an issue](poast/client/basecli.py)
 - Fork the repo and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/andrew-canaday/poast/compare) with a proposed implementation.

(You are welcome to fork, to your heart's content!)
